In this git branch, I have written a bunch of scripts in order to make the building of Android COMPLETELY AUTOMATED. So that means no writing commands, no looking at the webpage and copying commands, no running into errors. 


WARNING: How you use this script, it doesn't matter, but you CANNOT copy this script and make it into yours. I have added a little something to prevent just that.
This is for LineageOS only. I will try to create a RR script but it may take a while.
This is for Samsung Galaxy S5 (klte). This build will not work for any other phone, but will brick it.
The script files are version 1.0.0 right now. I will release updates bi-weekly to this github, which will possibly include new devices or new OS's.
