So, my scripts referred you to this file, right. Wow I made the smart. Okay, so it required a special variable that the script could not insert itself, so here I am with the required variable(s).

----------------------------------------------
Script: BuildENV2.sh

Variable:
	
# add Android SDK platform tools to path
if [ -d "$HOME/platform-tools" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/platform-tools:$PATH"
fi
